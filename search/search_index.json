On the left side is located multifunctional sidebar. It contains a list of created objects in opened project or property editor (more information below). On the right side is located a live preview and number of buttons allowing manipulation of the project file. Sidebar Sidebar can display a three different screens: List of layers in project, Property layer editor, Project settings editor. Layers list The default screen of sidebar it's a list of layers. At the bottom of the screen are located a buttons: New layer - opens a new item windows, Project settings - opens an editor of project settings, Delete a layer - deletes a selected value, Clone a layer - clones a selected value, Move up/down - changes the order of layers in the project. Double-clicking on the item in list of layers opens a property layer editor. Eye icons allows you to control the visibility of specific layers. Project editor Clicking button with a gear opens an editor of the project settings. You can change there a color of background or clock face. You can also change a size of generated PNG image in export. To return to the previous screen use the button with the X letter. Layer editor After creating a new layer sidebar opens a property editor. Editor allows you to adjust parameters to your needs. At the bottom of the screen are located a reset button and list of preview modificators: Display only this layer - hides all layers except edited layer, Bring to front this layer - displays the edited layer at the top of the project, Hide the overlay - hides a pulsing graphic overlay visible on the preview. Live preview A large part of right side of main window application consist a live preview. It reflects the current state of the list of layers with their visibility (eye button). At below is located a bar with the following buttons: Open a new project, Open a project from file, Save changes in project, Save project to new file, Import layers from another project, Export project to PNG image file, Open \"Welcome screen\", Open this documentation in web browser, Show more information about this application. New item window To create a new layer use the plus button below the list of layers. This will open the new item window and then: Choose a layer type using list with colorful squares (short description of selected type shows on the right side of this window), Give a name that describes its task, Select a \"Range Source\" - the layer of \"Range\" type (more information on \"Layer types\" page), Click an OK button at bottom of the window.","title":"Interface"},{"location":"interface/#main-interface","text":"Main interface consists of two parts.

In this application, there are many types of layers that add different objects to the project. By modifying properties ang changing they order you can create a lot of complex clock faces. Percentage values Numerical parameters in property editor are mostly based on percentages. It makes the sizes of the objects they describe are scaled to the size of the final raster graphics. For example: 50 in a circle radius property means 50% of the half width of the final graphic. -40 in an offset X property means shift to the left by 40% of the half width of the final graphics. Range \"Range\" type is the most important object and MUST be added first to the project. It is used to define position and size of the clock face. In addition, its task is to define the range of values that will be used by the clock we create. Why it must be defined first? When creating other types of layers, the application requires selecting the range to which the object will belong. The \"Range\" element is a common element connecting all layers belonging to one clock. Parameters of the \"Range\" layer: Circle position CircleCenter_X <-100; 100> - horizontal position of clock face CircleCenter_Y <-100; 100> - vertical position of clock face CircleRadius <20; 100> - radius of clock face Clock hands ClockHandsOffset_X <-80; 80> - horizontal offset of clock hands hook ClockHandsOffset_Y <-80; 80> - vertical offset of clock hands hook ClockHandsPointColor - dot color of clock hands hook ClockHandsPointSize <1; 5> - dot size of clock hands hook Range AngleStart <0; 360> - range start angle OpeningAngle <-360; 360> - opening angle of range (negative value means counter-clockwise) RangeEndValue <-1000; 1000> - maximum value of scale RangeStartValue <-1000; 1000> - minimum value of scale Linear Scale \"Linear Scale\" type is used to generate the radial lines on the basis of the range of values from \"Range\" layer. In parameters, you can specify the initial value, end value and scale step. The type also allows you to draw an arc on the whole range. Parameters of the \"Linear Scale\" layer: Lines DistanceFromCenter <20; 95> - distance between center of clock face and end of lines LineColor - color of lines LineLength <2; 100> - distance between center of clock face and start of lines LineThickness <2; 5> - line thickness Range DrawArcOnEdge - draw arc connecting all lines RangeMax <-1000; 1000> - maximum value of scale RangeMin <-1000; 1000> - minimum value of scale RangeStep <1; 1000> - jump of values between lines Numeric Scale \"Numeric Scale\" type is used to generate a numerical scale based on the range of values from \"Range\" layer. In parameters, you can specify the initial value, end value and scale step.

You can do it manually by giving the absolute angle or value from \"Range\" layer.

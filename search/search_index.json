A multifunctional sidebar is located on the left side. It contains a list of created objects in opened project or property editor (more information below). On the right side there is a live preview and number of buttons allowing manipulation of the project file. Sidebar Sidebar can display a three different screens: The list of layers in project, Property layer editor, Project settings editor. Layers list The default screen of sidebar is the list of layers. At the bottom of the screen are located the following buttons: New layer - opens a new item windows, Project settings - opens an editor of project settings, Delete a layer - deletes a selected value, Clone a layer - clones a selected value, Move up/down - changes the order of layers in the project. Double-clicking on the item on the list of layers opens the property layer editor. Eye icons allows you to control the visibility of specific layers. Project editor Clicking button with a gear opens the editor of the project settings. You can change here a color of background or clock face. You can also change the size of generated PNG image in export. To return to the previous screen use the button with the X letter. Layer editor After creating a new layer sidebar opens the property editor. Editor allows you to adjust parameters to your needs. At the bottom of the screen are located: the reset button and the list of preview modificators: Display only this layer - hides all layers except the edited layer, Bring to front this layer - displays the edited layer at the top of the project, Hide the overlay - hides a pulsing graphic overlay visible on the preview. Live preview A large part of right side of main window application consist a live preview. It reflects the current state of the list of layers with their visibility (eye button). Below is a bar with the following buttons: Open a new project, Open a project from file, Save changes in project, Save project to the new file, Import layers from another project, Export project to PNG image file, Open \"Welcome screen\", Open this documentation in a web browser, Show more information about this application. New item window To create a new layer use the plus button below the list of layers. It opens the new item window and then: Choose a layer type using list with colorful squares (short description of selected type shows on the right side of this window), Give a name that describes layer's task, Select a \"Range Source\" - the layer of \"Range\" type (more information on \"Layer types\" page), Click the OK button at bottom of the window.","title":"Interface"},{"location":"interface/#main-interface","text":"Main interface consists of two parts.

In this application, there are many types of layers that add different objects to the project. By modifying properties and changing layers' order you can create a lot of complex clock faces. Percentage values Numerical parameters in property editor are mostly based on percentages. It makes the sizes of the objects they describe are scaled to the size of the final raster graphics. For example: 50 in a circle radius property means 50% of the half width of the final graphic. -40 in an offset X property means shift to the left by 40% of the half width of the final graphics. Range \"Range\" type is the most important object and MUST be added first to the project. It is used for define position and size of the clock face. In addition, its task is to determine the range of values that will be use by the clock which we create. Why it must be defined first? While creating other types of layers, the application requires selection the range which the object belongs. The \"Range\" element is a common element connecting all layers belonging to one clock. Parameters of the \"Range\" layer: Circle position CircleCenter_X <-100; 100> - horizontal position of the clock face CircleCenter_Y <-100; 100> - vertical position of the clock face CircleRadius <20; 100> - radius of the clock face Clock hands ClockHandsOffset_X <-80; 80> - horizontal offset of the clock hands hook ClockHandsOffset_Y <-80; 80> - vertical offset of the clock hands hook ClockHandsPointColor - color of the clock hands hook's dot ClockHandsPointSize <1; 5> - size of the clock hands hook's dot Range AngleStart <0; 360> - range start angle OpeningAngle <-360; 360> - opening angle of range (negative value means counter-clockwise) RangeEndValue <-1000; 1000> - the maximum value of the scale RangeStartValue <-1000; 1000> - the minimum value of the scale Linear Scale Type \"Linear Scale\" is used for generate the radial lines on the basis of the range of values from \"Range\" layer. In parameters, you can specify the initial value, end value and scale step. The type also allows you to draw an arc on the whole range. Parameters of the \"Linear Scale\" layer: Lines DistanceFromCenter <20; 95> - distance between the center of the clock face and the end of lines LineColor - color of the lines LineLength <2; 100> - distance between the center of the clock face and the start of lines LineThickness <2; 5> - line thickness Range DrawArcOnEdge - draw arc connecting all lines RangeMax <-1000; 1000> - the maximum value of the scale RangeMin <-1000; 1000> - the minimum value of the scale RangeStep <1; 1000> - jump of values between the lines Numeric Scale Type \"Numeric Scale\" is used for generate a numerical scale based on the range of values from \"Range\" layer. In parameters, you can specify the initial value, the end value and the scale step. Parameters of the \"Numeric Scale\" layer: Font Bold - font modifier: bold FontColor - color of font FontFamily - name of font family FontSize <5; 20> - font size Italic - font modifier: italic Underline - font modifier: underline Position DistanceFromCenter <20; 100> - distance between the center of the clock face and the labels Rotated - tilt the labels to the center of the clock face Range RangeMax <-1000; 1000> - the maximum value of the scale RangeMin <-1000; 1000> - the minimum value of the scale RangeStep <1; 1000> - jump of values between the labels Rounding <0; 2> - number of leading zeros ScaleMultiplier <0.01; 100> - scale multiplier that allows you to change values of the scale Label \"Label\" type allows you to add a simple text label.

You can do it manually by giving the absolute angle or value from \"Range\" layer. Parameters of the \"Arc\" layer: Arc Color - color of the arc ManualAngle - range switch (false - range min/max; true - manual angle) Weight <1; 100> - arc thickness Position CircleOffset_X <-100; 100> - horizontal offset CircleOffset_Y <-100; 100> - vertical offset DistanceFromCenter <20; 100> - arc radius Range AngleStart <0; 360> - start angle OpeningAngle <-360; 360> - opening angle RangeMax <-1000; 1000> - end value of \"Range\" scale RangeMin <-1000; 1000> - start value of \"Range\" scale Clock Hand \"Clock Hand\" type adds a clock hand to the project.
